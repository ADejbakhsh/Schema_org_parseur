# Schema parser
https://schema.org/
Schema are all around the web, and contain useful information about the content of a webpage.

This parser is the equivalent of the https://validator.schema.org/, while it won't parse the url for you.
It will give you the same result as the validator.
Expect better because even if the json is not perfectly formatted, it will still try to parse with betterJSONParse.

For Now it only work on Json, it will work with itemprops soonâ„¢.
