# Schema parser
https://schema.org/
Schema are all around the web, and contain useful information about the content of a webpage.

This parser is the equivalent of the https://validator.schema.org/, while it won't fetch via the url for you.
It will give you the same result as the validator.

## limitation
For now it only works with JSON, this is still work in progress
